good after noon sir,
yes sir i can explain ....project as well .... practical
project ...
oooo okay ... then i design project using css html and 
php for backend with sql queries...
and another thing is that i dont use js in code ...
also ... it is purely maded by me ...
its not taken from git or any site ....

and its only login page design... 
i know its too much easy but ... i spend whole 8 days to 
make this one 
and i also make the register page for the design 
but i dont put it in project because of connection 
problem 
and my laptops static IP problem ...
problem is not in connection but it is pc 
like when ever i try to ececute it my local address changed
i dont know why ...

but now i know..hoe to resolve that..no inter net connection


now about project 
so project contain 3 html files 3 css style sheet and 1 login
file .php 
then
i make database in php admin
name as college info 
with table name info 
in that table i put username,password ,age and r_no as p.key

now table is ready with some containt i put in like 
username pikachu
password 1234 
age ...
r no

now the task is login for those who are alredy in dbtablle
 my login page take 2 parameter 
username and password 
so i put a query 
to take containt form table 
select * from info where username=$username adn password=$password

and if it take then 
it will check 2 parameter which take user input 
username and password 
so the point is 
that php can check the password and username are correct or 
not 
if they are correct then i put tne nect page locatio
other wise i put error message 
and put the first page location 

task complete 

this my project simple login page 
simplly you just need to login and if your in dbtable 
then you can visit the final page
